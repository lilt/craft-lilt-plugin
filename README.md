## Overview

The Lilt app can be used to send content within Craft CMS to be translated and localized into additional target languages by Lilt, saving you time while letting you continue to work in the systems you know.

Once your content is ready for translation, one click sends it to Lilt for translation, and you can track the translation status of your content right from within your Craft CMS instance.  Once translation is complete, Lilt sends the translated content back into Craft CMS for publishing.

You can also send any feedback to Lilt on the translation projects right from within Craft CMS, enabling your Lilt translator team to incorporate changes according to your preferences.

Features include:

- Quick access to Lilt translation services
- Localization progress status oversight directly within Craft CMS
- Translated content previewing, accepting, and rejecting
- Content publication scheduling
- Selection of specific content blocks for localization
